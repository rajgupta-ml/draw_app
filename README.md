# Collaborative Drawing App

This is a real-time collaborative whiteboard application built with Next.js and TypeScript. It provides a feature-rich canvas for users to draw, sketch, and collaborate on ideas using various tools and shapes. The application uses `rough.js` to give the drawings a hand-drawn, sketchy appearance.
